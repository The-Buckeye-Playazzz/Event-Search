# Event Search

## Description

Our deployed application can be viewed [here](https://the-buckeye-playazzz.github.io/Event-Search/)

Our team set out to address the following user story:

AS A tourist<br>
I WANT to search for local events<br>
SO THAT I can find a local event to attend.<br>

We've personally experienced the frustration of not being able to find a local event in a city you're traveling to, so we wanted to address that issue. We wanted to create a search engine that will not only tell you the weather of the city you're searching for, but will also list nearby events and a link to purchase a ticket. This makes it much easier to find local events to attend, especially if you're a traveling visitor.

By completing this project, our team gained experience with using third party APIs such as Ticketmaster and OpenWeather. We used these APIs to pull relevant data and we used Bootstrap to help us stylize that data to make it more presentable to the user.

Once the user types in the city and presses enter, the current weather is displayed on the right hand side and a list of events is displayed underneath.
